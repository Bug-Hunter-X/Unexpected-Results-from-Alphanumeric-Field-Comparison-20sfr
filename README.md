This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL programs: incorrect comparison of alphanumeric fields. The `bug.cob` file contains code that compares two alphanumeric fields using a simple equality check. This comparison can fail unexpectedly if there are trailing spaces or other padding involved in the fields. The `bugSolution.cob` file shows how to correctly compare these fields using the `REFERENCE MODIFICATION` clause to avoid unexpected behaviors.
